Description: Fast parallel gzip compression
 Rigz is a high-performance, parallel gzip implementation written in Rust.
 It provides 40-50% faster compression than gzip and pigz by leveraging
 multiple CPU cores, SIMD instructions, and optimized memory management.
 .
 Features:
  - Drop-in gzip replacement with compatible CLI
  - Parallel compression using all available cores
  - Memory-mapped I/O for zero-copy file access
  - Compatible output that works with all standard gzip tools
 .
 This package provides the rigz and unrigz commands.

Description: Replace system gzip with rigz (fast parallel gzip)
 This package replaces the system gzip, gunzip, gzcat, and zcat commands
 with rigz, providing significantly faster compression and decompression.
 .
 When installed, all system gzip operations will use rigz transparently.
 This is fully compatible with standard gzip - files compressed with rigz
 can be decompressed by any standard gzip implementation.
 .
 WARNING: This package conflicts with and replaces the gzip package.
 Install only if you want rigz to handle all gzip operations system-wide.
